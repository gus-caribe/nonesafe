    ## VoidSafe

    \t `VoidSafe` is a library that brings a `void-safe`, `None-aware` approach to            \
    Python3-written scripts and applications. It provides software developers with resources  \
    to apply `null-safe-like` principles to their codebase, guaranteeing that `safe`          \
    operations can be performed on `potentially unsafe` instances, which helps assuring that  \
    your software will be able to handle many memory-access problems at runtime.

    \t By being entirely `type-hinted`, this library works well when associated with most     \
    `static type checkers`. When combined with a linter that's capable of predicting `unboud` \
    or `undefined` variables, this library helps the developer to identify problems with      \
    their code even before running it.

    \t The inspiration comes from the concept of `Null Safety`, which is adopted by several   \
    programming languages, such as `Dart`, `Kotlin` and `C#`.
    ...

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ## `Special Constants`

    \t A `Special Constant` is used to perform crucial tasks or to represent values that \
    serve for the good usage of this library. What do we expect from a special constant  \
    syntax and semantic highlighting?

    - A `special color` that highlights the instance, making it easy to distinguish it 
    from ordinary instances;
    - A `docstring` that describes what the instance is supposed to perform or represent;
    - A `syntax` that doesn't pollute your code.

    \t Unfortunately, we couldn't find a way to declare, instantiate or decorate this    \
    library's resources in a way that the available linters could provide the            \
    developers with all of what's mentioned above. That said, we opted to provide two    \
    ways of using special constants:

    - `ThisWay` \\
    This is done by `class-decorating` a function with the special constant's type class.
    The result is an `instance` of that class (i.e. the Special Constant).

        - PROS:

            - Some linters will highlight it with the same color used to highlight       \
            `functions` and `methods`. That little hack allows for `distinguishing` it   \
            from ordinary instances;

            - It allows for declaring it with `UpperCamelCase` syntax, which tends to    \
            be "cleaner" than the the second way to use it.
        
        - CONS:

            - Most linters will either:
            
            1. (correctly) Interpret it as an instance but then highlight it as an       \
            `ordinary variable`; 

            2. Misinterpret what role the decorator should perform and then lose the     \
            reference to the instance's docstring, which `wipes the docstring` that      \
            should be shown on the tooltip of the IDE.

    - `THISWAY` \\
    This is done by declaring a Final-typed `constant` and assignining to it the value 
    holded by the instance described above.

        - PROS:

            - By declaring it with `UPPERCASE` syntax, which configures a constant in    \
            Python, most linters will highlight it with the color that's reserved for    \
            constants, which helps `distiguishing` it from other instances;

            - Because it's a regular constant definition, the `docstring` attached to    \
            its assignment will be correctly addressed by most of the available linters. \
            That way, the developer will be able to see a docstring explaining the       \
            Special Constant's usage.
        
        - CONS:

            - Python doesn't support defining an UpperCamelCase declaration as constant. \
            The only constants that can contain this syntax are the built-in ones, such  \
            as `None`, `True`, `False` and a few others. That's is a shame, because      \
            the `Undefined` Special Constant from the present library resides in the     \
            same semantic level as the `None` built-in constant, and it performs a       \
            similar role. This nature of the language results in the following           \
            implications: 
            
            1. It forces you to declare the Special Constant with an `UPPERCASE` syntax;

            2. That form of declaration tends to `pollute` your code as it "screams"     \
            the constant's name, especially if the constant is used frequently.

    ### â€£ VOIDSAFE

    \t `VOIDSAFE` is a `Special Constant` that acts as a wrapper protecting `potentially \
    unsafe instances` from having their `potentially unsafe resources` accessed.
    ...

    #### â€£ Potentially Unsafe Instances:

    \t `Potentially unsafe instances` are those that might be keeping a value that is    \
    not expected for a certain operation (like getting `None` when you expect a `str`).
    - Example:

        ```python
        >>> from typing import Optional
        >>> from random import random
        >>> 
        >>> unsafeStr: Optional[str] = None
        >>> 
        >>> if random() < 0.01:
        ...     unsafeStr = "This probably won't happen"
        ...
        >>> # 'unsafeStr' holds 'None' as its value
        >>> print( unsafeStr.upper() )
        AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'upper'
        ```
    ...

    #### â€£ Potentially Unsafe Resources

    \t `Potentially unsafe resources` of an instance refers to the instance's            \
    `.attributes`, `[items]` and `calls()` that hold `None` as their value OR the ones   \
    that haven't been `defined` at the moment they are being accessed.
    - Example:

        ```python
        >>> from typing import Optional
        >>> from random import random
        >>> 
        >>> class EmptyClass:
        ...     def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        ...         object.__setattr__(self, name, value)
        ... 
        >>> emptyInstance = EmptyClass()
        >>> 
        >>> if random() < 0.01:
        ...     emptyInstance.unsafeStr = "This probably won't happen"
        ... 
        >>> # 'unsafeStr' hasn't been defined for 'emptyInstance'
        >>> print( emptyInstance.unsafeStr )
        AttributeError: 'EmptyClass' object has no attribute 'unsafeStr'
        ```
    ...

    \t Usually, you can find if an instance/resource is potentially unsafe by checking   \
    if their values are into the `VOID` Special Constant provided by the present library.\
    Type `'VOID'` to see its usage.

    ##### â€£ Aliases: `value`
    ----

    \t `VALUE` is a `Special Constant` that allows you to use a `VoidSafe` chain of           \
    operations with the `>>` operator followed by `value`. This works as a getter that        \
    extracts the value that is being kept by `VoidSafe` or any of its subproducts.
    - Example:

        ```python
        >>> from typing import Optional
        >>> from voidsafe import VoidSafe, value
        >>> 
        >>> unsafeStr: Optional[str] = "content"
        >>> print( VoidSafe(unsafeStr).upper() >> value )
        CONTENT
        ```

    \t `VOID` is a `Special Constant` that keeps a list containing both `None` built-in  \
    constant and `UNDEFINED` Special Constant.

    \t It can be used to find out if a resource is either set as `None` or rather never  \
    been set (i.e. `UNDEFINED`).
    - Example:

        ```python
        >>> from voidsafe import VoidSafe, Void, value
        >>> 
        >>> testDict: dict[str, Any] = {}
        >>>

        >>> testDict['filled'] = 'filled'
        >>> 
        >>> # Here's what happens when you try to access a resource
        >>> # that has never been defined for an instance using 'VoidSafe'
        >>> VoidSafe(testDict)['undefined'] >> value
        Undefined
        >>> 
        >>> # Now, we'll check their relationship to 'Void'
        >>> 
        >>> testDict['none'] in Void
        True
